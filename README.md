# homework_unzip
A pair of shell scripts that unzip unis specified in a certain range. Great for TAs who upload bulk zip file submissions and need to unzip files and remove files of certain students.
QUICKSTART:
1) create two text files unis-rm.txt and file_renames.txt that contain the unis of students whose files need to be removed [if not being graded] whose homework submissions needs to be unzipped, respectively.
2) run remove.sh and rename.sh in any order.
3) you will come out will a clean directory of unzipped submissions!
